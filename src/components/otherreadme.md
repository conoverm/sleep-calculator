## Other Readme

This very small application was boostrapped with create-react-app. I left some of the cruft in the application, mainly because it did not effect the core requirements.

As stated in the create-react-app readme, `npm start` to start the application, `npm test` to test. I did not go into generating a production build and so forth. I just focused on hooks (which are basically new to me) and small components.

There are tests to cover the behaviors outlined in the doc. There is enough CSS to make the small application usable. 

If you have any further questions please reach out.
