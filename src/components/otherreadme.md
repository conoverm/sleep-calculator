## Other Readme

This very small application was boostrapped with create-react-app. I left some of the cruft in the application, mainly because it did not effect the core requirements.

There are tests to cover the behaviors outlined in the doc. There is enough CSS to make the small application usable. 

If you have any further questions please reach out.
